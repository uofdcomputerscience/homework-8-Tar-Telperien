U of D Mobile Development Homework 8

This is either the easiest or most difficult homework yet.

For this homework assignment, I need you to describe your intended final project to me. Include any intended data sources, sketches, and ask questions if needed.

I would like to make a calendar app which displays the current date and time in the Gregorian calendar (for comparison) and the current date in Tolkien's Elvish calendar both in English, with a button that allows you to convert the date and time to Tengwar. If that's not complicated enough, I can add some further calendar functionality, like the ability to create events.
